# Rename a lane back to free-N when its worker signals completion -- the
# second half of the dispatch/rename convention that agent-dotfiles#102
# found missing.
#
# WHY: dispatch.sh performs the first half automatically -- claim, worktree,
# rename to the task name, send. Nothing performed the second half, so every
# completed task permanently removed one lane from the pool until a human
# noticed `dispatch.sh` refusing "no free lane" and renamed by hand. That
# happened twice in one evening, 2026-08-11 (#102).
#
# WHY tied to the wait-for signal and nothing else: `lanes.sh` cannot tell
# "finished" from "idle between tool calls" or "blocked on an approval
# prompt holding an unposted verdict" -- all three read identically to
# `capture-pane`. Reclaiming on idle-alone was tried against a live lane the
# same night and nearly destroyed a verdict (#102). The worker's
# `tmux wait-for -S <channel>` is the one signal that cannot fire early: it
# is the brief's literal last instruction, sent only after everything else
# -- including posting a verdict -- is done (SPEC §14.1). Blocking on
# bare `wait-for` and renaming only when it returns needs no pane inspection
# at all, so it cannot mistake an approval prompt for completion.
#
# WHY the bare form and not `-L`: they are two different mechanisms, and only
# the bare form is the counterpart of the worker's `-S` (#108). `-L` locks a
# channel and blocks only against other *lockers*, released by `wait-for -U`;
# locking a never-locked channel succeeds immediately, and `-S` does not
# release a client blocked in `-L` at all. Verified against tmux 3.5:
#
#   $ timeout 3 tmux wait-for -L never-touched; echo $?
#   0                      # returns at once; nobody ever ran -S
#   $ timeout 3 tmux wait-for never-touched-2; echo $?
#   124                    # bare form blocks, as intended
#
# This script shipped with `-L` first, which made it rename every lane on the
# first call whether or not its worker had finished -- worse than the leak it
# was written to fix. tests/supervisor/test_lane_done.sh now covers the
# pairing against real tmux, not only against the stub.
#
# Usage: lane-done.sh <window-index> <expected-name> <channel> [session]
#
# <window-index>  the lane's tmux window index, e.g. what dispatch.sh sent
#                 the brief to.
# <expected-name> the task name dispatch.sh set on that window, e.g.
#                 `ad102-lane-rename-on-completion`. Renaming is refused if
#                 the window carries any other name when the signal arrives
#                 -- someone already handled it, or the lane was redispatched
#                 while this waiter was still up, and renaming now would
#                 steal the name out from under new work.
# <channel>       the wait-for channel named in the worker's brief. Nothing
#                 enforces uniqueness -- tmux channels are a flat global
#                 namespace on the server, and any `-S` on the same string
#                 releases this waiter, whoever sent it. Keep the convention
#                 every example here uses and tie the channel to the issue
#                 number (`ad102-done`), which makes collisions as unlikely
#                 as duplicate issue numbers.
#
# Run this BACKGROUNDED (Bash tool `run_in_background`, or `&` from a
# script) immediately after a successful dispatch, so the supervisor's tick
# stays free while it waits -- SPEC §14.3's fast path.
#
# Exit 0 only after a successful rename.
# Exit 1 if the channel was never signaled, or if the window no longer
#   carries <expected-name> when it was.
# `tmux wait-for` itself has no timeout (SPEC §14.2 L3): a worker that
# crashes or wedges before reaching its final action leaves this blocked
# forever, same as the underlying mechanism today. That is an accepted,
# already-documented limit of `wait-for`, not a new one introduced here.
