#!/bin/bash
# dispatch.sh must be the thing that CALLS lanes.sh, claim.sh and worktree.sh,
# so a lane cannot be handed work without a worktree of its own.
#
# WHY: agent-dotfiles#81. worktree.sh was built for #73 and, at the time, no
# script invoked `new`, `done` or `guard` -- the only references to it were
# three code fences in loop-tick.md and a section of the supervisor README.
# Enforcement was "the dispatcher reads the file and runs the command", which
# is the same mechanism whose failure produced #73 in the first place. The
# lesson from acp_transport.py (tested, zero importers) and from claim.sh
# (#74, wired the same day it landed) is that a tool with no caller is a
# documentation rule with a binary attached.
#
# The load-bearing test here is `a failed worktree aborts the dispatch`: if
# worktree.sh new fails and the brief goes out anyway, the lane works in the
# shared checkout, which IS #73. Sending nothing is the correct outcome.
